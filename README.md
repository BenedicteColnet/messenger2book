## Messenger

First, go on your Facebook account and download your messages and pictures. It can take a few hours, and to my experience you have to download all your messages and you can not choose only one conversation. You will obtain something like this:

.
+-- archived_threads
+-- inbox
|   +-- your_friend
+-- message_requests
+-- stickers_used

Note the name of the folder with the messages you are interested in. Typically it can contain gifs, photos, videos, audio and one - or several (ðŸ˜‰) - `json` files. It contains the messages in questions.
